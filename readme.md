title: Spatial Weights from a Graph Attention Network
---


_"The weights matrix should bear a direct relationship to a theoretical conceptualization of the structure of dependence, rather than reflecting an ad hoc description of spatial pattern"_

A Graph Attention Network (GAT) can be employed to learn the spatial weights matrix \( W \) in a data-driven manner. By utilizing attention mechanisms, the GAT can focus on the most relevant spatial relationships, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of spatial dependencies.

A spatial weights matrix is a key input into a Spatial Regression Framework, influencing the estimation of spatial relationships.
