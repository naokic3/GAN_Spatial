  abstract = {Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.},

An existing database of indicators identified in a previous review was reassessed for measures of factors that shape community structures and conditions, which place people at risk for violence. Indicators of 86 community constructs are reported. These indicators may help to advance the field by offering innovative metrics that can be used to investigate further the structural and social determinants that serve as root causes of inequities in violence risk.},

To account for this dependence we decompose the spatial covariance function of growth rates into a function of each country’s own observable characteristics, its unobservable characteristics, and cross-country spillovers. We use original data on economic distance to structure observed variation in countries’ long term growth rates. We use this structure to estimate the magnitude of economic interdependence among nations, and to give a nonparametric characterization of the relationship between economic distance and the magnitude of cross-country spillovers. These spillovers turn out to be quite important, accounting for more of the spatial covariance in growth rates than unobservable variables, and by some measures rivalling the importance of the country’s own observable characteristics.},

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.}

  abstract = {Worldwide, about one in eight people live in a slum. Empirical studies based on satellite data have identified that the size distributions of this type of settlement are similar in different cities of the Global South. Based on this result, a model was developed that describes the formation of slums with a Turing mechanism, in which patterns are created by diffusion-driven instability and the inherent characteristic length of the system is independent of boundary conditions. It has not yet been taken into account that Turing patterns usually arrange themselves regularly, while slums are often found in clusters. Therefore, this study investigates to what extent a common reaction kinetics for Turing models can be adapted to represent a locally concentrated arrangement of objects and to adapt the size distribution of the objects to the empirical results. Based on a summary of the literature and two numerical studies, it can be shown that although it is possible to adapt the model to the empirical data, this also increases the complexity of the model.},

Although the notions of place and space are fundamentally intertwined, spatial criminology is distinct in its attempt to measure and theorize explicitly spatial processes and relationships. This review highlights three key themes. First, the use of increasingly smaller geographic units in recent research creates an even greater need to account for spatial behavior of persons when studying the location of crime. Second, although the explosion of spatially precise data in recent years presents exciting possibilities, we argue that theory is falling behind in guiding us in analyzing these new forms of data, and explicitly inductive approaches should be considered to complement existing deductive strategies. Third, an important direction for spatial criminology in the next decade is considering the extent to which micro- and mesolevel processes operate invariantly across different macro contexts.},

These indices, which indicate the vitality of vegetation and are not constant over time, serve as a basis for predicting deforestation trends. Advanced forecasting models, including XGBoost, SARIMAX, and Prophet, are used to estimate deforestation rates for future intervals of one to ten years, based on the dataset and model specifics. The accuracy of these predictions is primarily assessed using the root mean square error (RMSE) to ensure the reliability of the model assessments.

However, scientists have recognized shortcomings when the model is used as the working hypothesis in biological experiments, particularly in studies in which the underlying molecular network is not fully understood. To address some such problems, this report proposes a new version of the Turing model. This alternative model is not represented by partial differential equations, but rather by the shape of an activation-inhibition kernel. Therefore, it is named the kernel-based Turing model (KT model). Simulation of the KT model with kernels of various shapes showed that it can generate all standard variations of the stable 2D patterns (spot, stripes and network), as well as some complex patterns that are difficult to generate with conventional mathematical models. The KT model can be used even when the detailed mechanism is poorly known, as the interaction kernel can often be detected by a simple experiment and the KT model simulation can be performed based on that experimental data. These properties of the KT model complement the shortcomings of conventional models and will contribute to the understanding of biological pattern formation.},

  abstract = {Fractional tree cover facilitates the depiction of forest density and its changes. However, it remains challenging to estimate tree cover from satellite data, leading to substantial uncertainties in forest cover changes analysis. This paper generated a global annual fractional tree cover dataset from 2000 to 2021 with 250\,m resolution (GLOBMAP FTC). MODIS annual observations were realigned at the pixel level to a common phenology and used to extract twelve features that can differentiate between trees and herbaceous vegetation, which greatly reduced feature dimensionality. A massive training data, consisting of 465.88 million sample points from four high-resolution global forest cover products, was collected to train a feedforward neural network model to predict tree cover. Compared with the validation datasets derived from the USGS circa 2010 global land cover reference dataset, the R2 value, MAE, and RMSE were 0.73, 10.55\%, and 17.98\%, respectively. This dataset can be applied for assessment of forest cover changes, including both abrupt forest loss and gradual forest gain.},

Yet, only recently has the influence of the surrounding landscape on invasive species spread started to be considered. The scientific community increasingly recognizes the need for broader modeling framework that focuses on cross‐study comparisons at different spatiotemporal scales. Using two illustrative examples, we introduce a general modeling framework that allows for a systematic investigation of the effect of habitat change on invasive species establishment and spread. The essential parts of the framework are (i) a mechanistic spatially explicit model (a modular dispersal framework—               MDIG               ) that allows population dynamics and dispersal to be modeled in a geographical information system (               GIS               ), (ii) a landscape generator that allows replicated landscape patterns with partially controllable spatial properties to be generated, and (iii) landscape metrics that depict the essential aspects of landscape with which dispersal and demographic processes interact. The modeling framework provides functionality for a wide variety of applications ranging from predictions of the spatiotemporal spread of real species and comparison of potential management strategies, to theoretical investigation of the effect of habitat change on population dynamics. Such a framework allows to quantify how small‐grain landscape characteristics, such as habitat size and habitat connectivity, interact with life‐history traits to determine the dynamics of invasive species spread in fragmented landscape. As such, it will give deeper insights into species traits and landscape features that lead to establishment and spread success and may be key to preventing new incursions and the development of efficient monitoring, surveillance, control or eradication programs.},

However, engineering these patterns and demonstrating that they are produced by this mechanism is challenging. To address this, we aim to solve the inverse problem in artificial and experimental Turing patterns. This task is challenging since high levels of noise corrupt the patterns and slight changes in initial conditions can lead to different patterns. We used both least squares to explore the problem and physics-informed neural networks to build a noise-robust method. We elucidate the functionality of our network in scenarios mimicking biological noise levels and showcase its application through a prototype involving an experimentally obtained chemical pattern. The findings reveal the significant promise of machine learning in steering the creation of synthetic patterns in bioengineering, thereby advancing our grasp of morphological intricacies within biological systems while acknowledging existing limitations.},

To take effective measures against language endangerment, it is essential to quantitatively understand its characteristics because it is a phenomenon in which historical, geographical, and economic factors are intricately intertwined. In this study, multilayer language-country bipartite networks are constructed using information about which countries each language is spoken in and two types of linguistic features, namely the existence of a writing system and the function within a country. In addition, percolation simulations are conducted to measure how language and country networks break down according to the extinction of languages and to identify vulnerable connections in them. In the language network of officially used languages with their writing system, the community analysis indicated that there were communities composed of languages spoken over geographically separated distances. The strength of languages revealed that the official languages in the former colonial nations, namely English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and Russian, still played significant roles in the formation of these communities. In the language and country networks of unofficially used languages without their writing system, the percolation simulation revealed that languages were likely to severely disappear in the Americas, and that linguistic diversity was vulnerable in affluent countries. The findings show that the analysis of multilayer language-country bipartite networks has enabled a quantitative understanding of the language endangerment occurring worldwide from historical, geographical, and economic perspectives.},

These models are rich enough to speak to first-order features of the data, such as many heterogeneous locations and gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting. At the same time, these models are sufficiently tractable to undertake realistic counterfactual exercises to study the effect of changes in amenities, productivity, and public policy interventions such as transport infrastructure investments.

  abstract = {Monitoring forest cover change from Earth observation data streams in near-real-time presents a challenge for automated change detection by way of a continuously updated big dataset. Even though deforestation is a significant global problem, forest cover changes in pairs of subsequent images happen relatively infrequently. Detecting a change can require the download and processing of tens, hundreds or even thousands of images. In geoscientific applications of Earth observation, machine learning algorithms are increasingly used. Once trained, a machine learning model can be applied to new images automatically. This paper introduces the open-access Python 3 package Pyeo - “Python for Earth Observation”. Pyeo provides a set of portable, extensible and modular Python functions for the automation of machine learning applications from Earth observation data streams, including automated search and download functionality, pre-processing and atmospheric correction, re-projection, creation of thematic base layers and machine learning classification or regression. Pyeo enables users to train their own machine learning models and then apply the models to newly downloaded imagery over their area of interest. This paper describes in detail how Pyeo works, its requirements, benefits, and a description of the libraries used. An application to the automated forest cover change detection in a region in Kenya is given. Pyeo can be used on cloud computing architectures such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Colab to provide scalable applications and processing solutions for the geosciences.},

These slums evoke a more or less stereotype impression of built environments: complex, high dense alignments of small makeshift or run-down shelters. However, this perceived characteristic morphology is neither globally homogeneous nor is this perception covering morphologic appearances of urban poverty in a comprehensive way. This research provides an empirical baseline study of existing morphologies, their similarities and differences across the globe. To do so, we conceptually approach urban poverty as places which provide relatively cheap living spaces serving as possible access to the city, to its society and to its functions – so called Arrival Cities. Based on a systematic literature survey we select a sample of 44 Arrival Cities across the globe. Using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with street view images and field work we derive level of detail-1 3D-building models for all study areas. We measure the spatial structure of these settlements by the spatial pattern (by three features – building density, building orientation and heterogeneity of the pattern) and the morphology of individual buildings (by two features – building size and height). We develop a morphologic settlement type index based on all five features allowing categorization of Arrival Cities. We find a large morphologic variety for built environments of the urban poor, from slum and slum-like structures to formal and planned structures. This variability is found on all continents, within countries and even within a single city. At the same time detected categories (such as slums) are found to have very similar physical features across the globe.},

  abstract = {Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) are of importance in natural resource management, environmental modelling and assessment, and agricultural production management. However, LULCC detection and modelling is a complex, data-driven process in the remote sensing field due to the processing of massive historical and current data, real-time interaction of scenario data, and spatial environmental data. In this paper, we review principles and methods of LULCC modelling, using machine learning and beyond, such as traditional cellular automata (CA). Then, we examine the characteristics, capabilities, limitations, and perspectives of machine learning. Machine learning has not yet been dramatic in modelling LULCC, such as urbanization prediction and crop yield prediction because competition and transition between land cover types are dynamic at a local scale under varying natural drivers and human activities. Upcoming challenges of machine learning in modelling LULCC remain in the detection and prediction of LULC evolutionary processes if considering their applicability and feasibility, such as the spatio-temporal transition mechanisms to describe occurrence, transition, spreading, and spatial patterns of changes, availability of training data of all the change drivers, particularly sequence data, and identification and inclusion of local ecological, hydrological, and social-economic drivers in addressing the spectral feature change. This review points out the need for multidisciplinary research beyond image processing and pattern recognition of machine learning in accelerating and advancing studies of LULCC modelling. Despite this, we believe that machine learning has strong potentials to incorporate new exploratory variables in modelling LULCC through expanding remote sensing big data and advancing transient algorithms.},

  abstract = {Cellular automata belong to a family of discrete, connectionist techniques being used to investigate fundamental principles of dynamics, evolution, and self-organization. In this paper, a cellular automaton is developed to model the spatial structure of urban land use over time. For realistic parameter values, the model produces fractal or bifractal land-use structures for the urbanized area and for each individual land-use type. Data for a set of US cities show that they have very similar fractal dimensions. The cellular approach makes it possible to achieve a high level of spatial detail and realism and to link the results directly to general theories of structural evolution.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel method for constructing an asymmetric spatial weight matrix and applies it to improve spatial econometric modeling. As opposed to traditional spatial weight matrices that simply consider geographic or economic proximity, the spatial weight matrix proposed in this study is based on large-volume daily population flow data. It can more accurately reflect the socioeconomic interactions between cities over any given period. To empirically test the validity and accuracy of this proposed spatial weight matrix, we apply it to a spatial econometric model that analyzes COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China. Specifically, this matrix is used to address spatial dependence in outcome and explanatory variables and to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all predictors. We also propose a practical framework that combines instrumental variable regressions and a Hausman test to validate the exogeneity of this matrix. The test result confirms its exogeneity; hence, it can produce consistent estimates in our spatial econometric models. Moreover, we find that spatial econometric models using our proposed population flow–based spatial weight matrix significantly outperform those using the traditional inverse distance weight matrix in terms of goodness of fit and model interpretation, thus providing more reliable results. Our methodology not only has implications for national epidemic control and prevention policies but can also be applied to a wide range of research to better address spatial autocorrelation issues.

  abstract = {Spatial distribution of the human population is distinctly heterogeneous, e.g. showing significant difference in the population density between urban and rural areas. In the historical perspective, i.e. on the timescale of centuries, the emergence of densely populated areas at their present locations is widely believed to be linked to more favourable environmental and climatic conditions. In this paper, we challenge this point of view. We first identify a few areas at different parts of the world where the environmental conditions (quantified by the temperature, precipitation and elevation) show a relatively small variation in space on the scale of thousands of kilometres. We then examine the population distribution across those areas to show that, in spite of the approximate homogeneity of the environment, it exhibits a significant variation revealing a nearly periodic spatial pattern. Based on this apparent disagreement, we hypothesize that there may exist an inherent mechanism that may lead to pattern formation even in a uniform environment. We consider a mathematical model of the coupled demographic-economic dynamics and show that its spatially uniform, locally stable steady state can give rise to a periodic spatial pattern due to the Turing instability, the spatial scale of the emerging pattern being consistent with observations. Using numerical simulations, we show that, interestingly, the emergence of the Turing patterns may eventually lead to the system collapse.},
